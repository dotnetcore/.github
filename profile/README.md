**.NET Core Community** (referred to as **NCC**) is an unofficial, non-profit open source community based on the .NET technology stack. We hope that through our efforts, we can make the .NET ecosystem more exciting.

NCC was founded in mid-2016, and has received support from numerous organizations, companies, and developers both domestically and internationally in the past few years.

Without accumulating small steps, one cannot reach a thousand miles; without gathering small streams, one cannot become a vast sea. The outstanding member projects in the NCC community will bring surprises and efficiency improvements to every developer.
